## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Google Gemini API Key** (free from Google AI Studio)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Or with yarn
yarn install
```

### 2. Get Your Gemini API Key

1. Set up your Supabase project and get the environment variables
2. Configure your database schema using the provided migrations

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

**Important**: Never commit your keys to version control. The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore`.

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev

# In a separate terminal, start the widget API server:
npm run server
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and the widget API at `http://localhost:3001`

### 5. Testing Widget Embeds

To test your widgets on external websites:

1. Create a widget in the dashboard
2. Copy the embed code
3. Open `public/test-widget.html` in your browser
4. Replace the placeholder with your actual embed code
5. Refresh to see your widget working

The embed code looks like:
```html
<script src="http://localhost:5173/widget/your-widget-id.js" async></script>
```

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx          # Main application component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tsx         # Application entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css        # Global styles and Tailwind imports
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vite-env.d.ts    # Vite environment type definitions

.env                 # Environment variables (API key)
package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
tailwind.config.js   # Tailwind CSS configuration
vite.config.ts       # Vite configuration
```

### Key Components and Functions

#### Main State Management
- `qaHistory`: Array of Q&A items with ratings and metadata
- `isLoading`: Loading state during API calls
- `error`: Error message display

#### Core Functions
- `getGeminiResponse()`: Handles Gemini API communication
- `askQuestion()`: Processes form submission and manages state
- `rateAnswer()`: Updates answer ratings
- `markAsBest()`: Manages best answer selection
- `copyToClipboard()`: Handles clipboard operations

## API Integration

The application uses Google's Gemini Pro model with optimized prompting:

```typescript
const prompt = `Please provide a comprehensive and accurate answer to the following question: ${question}

Please make sure your answer is:
- Clear and well-structured
- Factually accurate
- Helpful and informative
- Easy to understand

Question: ${question}`;
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# Or with yarn
yarn build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Google Gemini API key | ‚úÖ Yes |

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Protection**: Environment variables are used to protect your API key
- **Client-side Limitation**: API key is exposed in the client build (consider using a backend proxy for production)
- **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of Gemini API rate limits and quotas

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Please set your Gemini API key" Error**
   - Check that your `.env` file contains the correct API key
   - Ensure the key starts with `VITE_` prefix
   - Restart the development server after adding the key

2. **API Connection Issues**
   - Verify your API key is valid and active
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure you haven't exceeded API quotas

3. **Build Issues**
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
   - Update dependencies: `npm update`
